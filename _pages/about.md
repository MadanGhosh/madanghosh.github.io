# About Me

Hi! I’m **Madanmohan Ghosh**, a Principal Economist at the Bank of Canada within the Canadian Economic Analysis Department. My work focuses on the intersection of economics and environmental policy, particularly the macroeconomic impacts of climate change.

My research is primarily centered on the social and economic aspects of energy and environmental policy, international trade, and public finance. I am especially interested in how major economies transition toward net-zero emissions and the role of transformative technologies in decarbonizing industrial sectors.

### My Work and Research

I am an applied economist specializing in large-scale policy analysis. I primarily use **Computable General Equilibrium (CGE)** modeling, alongside **Integrated Assessment Models (IAM)** and **DSGE frameworks**, to investigate complex policy issues. My work seeks to provide quantitative insights into the costs and benefits of greenhouse gas abatement, carbon pricing, and the economic shifts required for global sustainability.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated with diverse research networks to compare welfare effects of regional climate coalitions and to assess the status of energy and emission trends in global modeling. My previous work has also touched on the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI), the economic implications of trade arrangements (like the WTO and FTAs), and the shadow pricing of foreign exchange.

### My Background and History

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from **Jawaharlal Nehru University** in New Delhi, where my dissertation focused on Indian trade policy and regional trade arrangements. A significant portion of my doctoral work was completed at Western University in Ontario as a Shastri-Indo Canadian Fellow. Following my doctorate, I completed a Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Western University.

Before joining the Bank of Canada in 2022, I spent over a decade as a Senior Advisor and Chief of the CGE Modeling Section at **Environment and Climate Change Canada**. My career in the Canadian federal government also includes senior roles at the Department of Finance and Industry Canada. I have also remained active in academia as a contract instructor and research fellow at Carleton University and Western University.

### My Professional Communities

I am an active member of several professional organizations, including:
* **American Economic Association (AEA)**
* **Canadian Economic Association (CEA)**
* **International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE)**

I also serve as a peer reviewer for numerous journals, such as *Energy Economics*, *Energy Policy*, and the *Canadian Journal of Economics*. I frequently present my research at major international conferences, including upcoming sessions at the **ASSA Annual Meeting in 2026** on the influence of carbon prices on inflation.
