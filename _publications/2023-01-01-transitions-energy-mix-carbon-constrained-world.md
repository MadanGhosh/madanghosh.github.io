## Overview
This paper evaluates how the availability and deployment of zero and net-negative emission technologies influence global mitigation pathways and macroeconomic costs under stringent carbon constraints. Using an integrated assessment modelling framework, the analysis highlights the importance of technological portfolios in achieving cost-effective climate stabilization targets.
